MultiPass is an easy to use, clipboard based password manager.

EZ-start instructions:

* The first time you run MultiPass, you will need to create a master password.  Click 'File' and select 'Create Master Password', then enter a password that you will NEVER forget in the 'Master Password' box.  This will be the only password you will need to remember.  Enter the same password in the 'Verify Master Password' box to make sure nothing was mistyped, then click 'Set Master Password'.  This creates the password vault which is secured by the master password.

* You can change the master password at any time by clicking 'File' and selecting 'Modify Master Password'.  You will have to enter your current master password, then your new master password, followed by your new master password again to make sure nothing was mistyped.

* After your master password is set, you can add, modify, and delete encrypted password entries by selecting the respective selections under the 'Passwords' menu item.

* To retrieve and use a password, select the password entry you would like to retrieve, then enter your master password to decrypt.  A notification will appear informing you that the password you selected has been copied to your clipboard.  You can now paste it where you need it.

* After you are done using your password, you can click the 'Clear Clipboard' button to clear your password from the clipboard to prevent accidental pasting of your password.
